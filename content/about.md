I am a research associate based at the Kavli Institute for Cosmology, Institute of Astronomy, University of Cambridge. I additionally consult as a Data Scientist for [PolyChord Ltd.](https://polychord.io). I am an early career researcher aiming to bring together a mix of interests in Machine Learning and precision fundamental science. Previously I completed a PhD at University College London, where I worked at CERN on the ATLAS experiment. Currently I am a member of [Will Handley's research group](https://handley-lab.co.uk) 



Current specific topics of interest:
 - Cosmology, accelerated likelihoods for Gravitational Wave Physics and CMB physics.
 - Simulation Based inference, interfacing generative AI with scientific inference problems.
 - MCMC methods, particularly with a view to building scalable GPU inference tools.

### Current Work

I am currently building frameworks in [JAX](https://github.com/jax-ml/jax), a high-performance numerical computing library for machine learning research, and working extensively with [BlackJAX](https://blackjax-devs.github.io/blackjax/), a library of samplers for JAX that provides state-of-the-art MCMC and variational inference algorithms.

I am happy to discuss any of these topics, and open to contact for collaboration.

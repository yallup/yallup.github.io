I'm a research associate at the Kavli Institute for Cosmology, University of Cambridge, and an AI researcher at [PolyChord Ltd.](https://polychord.io), working at the intersection of probabilistic machine learning and precision fundamental physics. My work focuses on scalable probabilistic inference to solve cutting-edge scientific inference problems. I completed my PhD at UCL while working on the ATLAS experiment at CERN, and have published work in top physics journals as well as presenting at top-tier AI conference venues (NeurIPS, ICLR). I'm part of [Will Handley's research group](https://handley-lab.co.uk), where I build tools that make state-of-the-art uncertainty quantification practical for real-world scientific and engineering systems. 



Current specific topics of interest:
 - Cosmology, accelerated likelihoods for Gravitational Wave Physics and CMB physics.
 - Simulation Based inference, interfacing generative AI with scientific inference problems.
 - MCMC methods, particularly with a view to building scalable GPU inference tools.
 - Particle Monte Carlo methods, Nested sampling and Sequential Monte Carlo

### Current Work

I am currently building frameworks in [JAX](https://github.com/jax-ml/jax), a high-performance numerical computing library for machine learning research, and working extensively with [BlackJAX](https://blackjax-devs.github.io/blackjax/), a library of samplers for JAX that provides state-of-the-art MCMC and variational inference algorithms.

I am happy to discuss any of these topics, and open to contact for collaboration.

I am a research associate based at the Kavli Institute for Cosmology, Institute of Astronomy, University of Cambridge. I additionally consult as a Data Scientist for [PolyChord Ltd.](https://polychord.io). I am an early career researcher aiming to bring together a mix of interests in Machine Learning and precision fundamental science. Previously I completed a PhD at University College London, where I worked at CERN on the ATLAS experiment. Currently I am a member of [Will Handley's research group](https://handley-lab.co.uk) 



Current specific topics of interest:
 - Cosmology, accelerated likelihoods for Gravitational Wave Physics and CMB physics.
 - Simulation Based inference, interfacing generative AI with scientific inference problems.
 - MCMC methods, particularly with a view to building scalable GPU inference tools.


I am happy to discuss any of these topics, and open to contact for collaboration.
